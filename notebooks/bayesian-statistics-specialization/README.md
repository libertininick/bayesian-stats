# Bayesian Statistics Specialization
This directory holds notebooks related to the [Bayesian Statistics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bayesian-statistics)

## Environment requirements
- These notebooks make use of [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html):
    - PyMC is a probabilistic programming library for Python that allows users to build Bayesian models with a simple Python API and fit them using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

- I also use [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) for comparisons to MLE methods.
```sh
conda activate bayesian_stats
python -m pip install pymc statsmodels
```
